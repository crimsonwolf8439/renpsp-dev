【 Acknowledgments 】

This software could never have been completed if it were just me alone.

To KeNji and ASOBEAT, who provided such beautiful music,
To WEB WAVE LIB, who provided so many crisp sound effects,
And to Naoki Takahashi, who developed NScripter,
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
If it weren't for you I'd never have been able to do this.

I'd also like to thank everyone who has been nurturing my clumsy efforts:
To everyone over at Rispetto (http://rispetto.net), especially Susumu Fuji,
As well as all of you who have downloaded and enjoyed this piece,
My profound gratitude.
